introduction
------------

Spreadsheet provides procedures for building and using tables and 
spreadsheets in OpenACS. It is an OpenACS package that allows convenient 
building and interpreting of web-based sheets via tcl in a web page.

Standard spreadsheets are not yet supported.

features
--------

Integrates well with Q-Forms or any web-based form processing.

Can manipulate Tcl list of lists for easy generation of reports.

There are procedures for importing, rotating, and exporting tables
in various formats, including changing Tcl lists to arrays 
and lists to scalar variables.

Simple Table API is for tables represented as text, where each line is a row, and 
each cell is separated by a common or specified delimiter.

TIPS "Table Integrated Publishing System" API is a database
paradigm used extensively for developing data models in flux 
and importing or converting databases from one format to another.
It was first developed in the 1990's.


Simple Table API
----------------

One key feature is Simple Table's ability to guess at most likely common field
and end-of-line delimiters based on a statistical analysis of text.


TIPS API
--------

TIPS API is based on the flexibility of spreadsheets, where:

*   There is no difference between a cell with null or empty string value.

*   There are only 3 "formula" types, numeric, text and vc1k (varchar(1025)).

*   Any type can have an empty value.

*   A vc1k declared column can be referenced by first or most recent, 
    or all cases of search-string. Foreign Keys are not constrained.

*   A missing key returns an empty row/cell. In essence code level errors are avoided.

*   Data updates can be by row or cell or column.

*   Unreferenced columns are ignored. 

*   All columns are assumed if none referenced.

*   Rows and columns are referenced by internal row_id and field_id (column) or field/column "label".

*   Tables can be imported via Simple Table's TCL representation of a table in list of lists format,
    where the first row contains column labels.

Revisioning is trackable per cell and timestamp, for implementing an "undo" or revisioning capability.
